# 1. Description

Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system to help understand the context of your design decisions. You can reuse and update text from the previous deliverables.

Grading criteria (2 points): Completeness; Consistency with the rest of the document; Adequate language.

# 2. Architecture

![Package Diagram](./images/D5_2.jpg)

The architecture is set up like this because this is how our file structure works in a nutshell. It helps define what packages depend on, use, or access to other packages. For example, the frontend needs access to the backend so the user can see what is stored on their profile. Other packages like Server use imports that help with development, data storage, and deployment.

# 3. Class Diagram

# 4. Sequence Diagram

Present a sequence diagram that represents how the objects in your system interact for a specific use case. Also include the use case's description in this section. The sequence diagram should be consistent with the class diagram and architecture. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of the sequence diagram; Consistency with the class diagram; Consistency with the use case description; Not including the use case description; Over simplistic diagram.

# 5. Design Patterns

Split this section into two subsections. For each subsection, present a UML class diagram showing the application of a design pattern to your system (a different pattern for each section). Each class diagram should contain only the classes involved in the specific pattern (you donâ€™t need to represent the whole system). You are not limited to design patterns studied in class. You can pick any pattern, including those outside the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns. You can see the list of GoF patterns here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

Tip: Your system may not be appropriate for any design pattern. In this case, for didactic purposes, be creative and extend the scope of your system slightly to make the design patterns appropriate. 

Implement each design pattern in your system and provide GitHub links to the corresponding classes. For example (the links are illustrative, aka fake!):

Pattern name: Strategy

Car: [https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Car.javaLinks](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Car.javaLinks)

IBreakBehavior: [https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/IBreakBehavior.java](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/IBreakBehavior.java)

BrakeWithABS: [https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/BrakeWithABS.java](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/BrakeWithABS.java)

Brake: [https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Brake.java](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Brake.java) 

Grading criteria (6 points, 3 for each pattern): Correct use of the design pattern as described in the literature; adequate implementation of the design pattern.

# 6. Design Principles

How does your design observe design principles? Provide a short description of the principles followed and concrete examples from your code. Describe at least two principles.

Grading criteria (6 points): Show a correct understanding of design principles; Provide enough details to justify how the principles were observed.
